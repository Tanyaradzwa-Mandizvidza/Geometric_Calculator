# Geometric_Calculator Development
A Python tool to calculate areas and perimeters/circumferences for rectangles and circles Simple and versatile.

The Geometric Calculator is a Python program that simplifies the process of calculating the area and, when applicable, the perimeter or circumference of geometric shapes such as rectangles and circles. This tool is designed to be simple and versatile, making it useful for both students studying geometry and individuals who need quick and accurate measurements for practical applications.

## Features
You can calculate the area of rectangles and circles.Optionally, calculate the perimeter of rectangles or the circumference of circles.The calculator has a user-friendly interface with clear instructions, and it supports various units of measurement.

## How to Use
1. Choose the shape you want to calculate: rectangle or circle.
2. Enter the required parameters (e.g., length and width for rectangles, or radius for circles).
3. The program will calculate and display the area and, if applicable, the perimeter or circumference.

## Getting Started
To run the Geometric Calculator on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your computer.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
3. Run the script using the command: `python area_calculator.py`.
